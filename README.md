# final-project

This project is the culmination of my studies at the Iron Yard and by far my proudest achievement at this point. The goal of this app is to allow users to search for mountain bike trails and for the app to provide current and relevant information about each trail. This is my most robust production and was built using React and Backbone.

This app uses two different API's to draw information (one to draw trail information, one for weather), as well as displaying user submitted data that is stored on Parse. Users can search for trail by entering a city and/or state or using geolocation to provide trails within 25 miles of their location. When looking at a trail, users can submit information about a ride including comments, a rating, and a picture. User submitted data is displayed on the trail page and the Current Rating number in the Trail Conditions box is updated. This rating averages all user data submitted about that trail over the last three days. Users can also favorite trails to make finding the same trails quick and easy.

Feel free to create an account and submit data or just poke around. I have listed a couple trails with dummy data below

Examples with data:
Hub City Trail System in Spartanburg, South Carolina
Colonie Shale/the Pits Trail in Latham, New York
